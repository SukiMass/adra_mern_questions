  //  Question:
  //           Implement a CRUD application for managing blog posts in a MERN stack.\n
  //  Backend:
  //          Create an Express server with routes to:
  //          Create a new blog post.
  //          Read all blog posts.
  //          Read a specific blog post by ID.
  //          Update a blog post by ID.
  //          Delete a blog post by ID.
  //          Use MongoDB to store the blog posts with fields like title, content, author, and created_at.\n
  //  Frontend:
  //           Create a simple React UI with a form for creating and updating blog posts.
  //           Display a list of blog posts and allow users to click on a post to view its details.

  //  Question:
  //           Build a MERN stack login and registration system with hashed passwords.\n
  //  Backend:
  //          Create a user registration system where users can register with a username, email, and password.
  //          Hash the password using bcrypt before saving it in the database.
  //          Implement login functionality where the password is compared with the hashed one.
  //          Use JWT for authentication and return a token upon successful login.
  //  Frontend:
  //           Create a React UI with forms for registration and login.
  //           Store the JWT in localStorage after login and use it for authenticated requests.

  Question_3: `
  //  Question:
  //           Implement real-time chat functionality using Socket.IO in a MERN stack application.\n
  //  Backend:
  //          Set up Socket.IO on the Node.js server to allow real-time communication.
  //          Create an API to store and retrieve chat messages from MongoDB.
  //  Frontend:
  //          Set up Socket.IO on the React client and allow users to send and receive messages in real-time.

  //          PART - 1
  //            Create a login form responsively with two fields: Username and Password.
  //            Implement basic validation:
  //            If either field is empty, show an error message.
  //            Use a hardcoded username and password for simplicity (e.g., admin / password123).
